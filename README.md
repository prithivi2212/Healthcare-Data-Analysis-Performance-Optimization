# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-Performance-Optimization

This project analyzes hospital performance data over two decades (2000â€“2024) to improve patient care efficiency and operational effectiveness. Leveraging Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and Excel, the raw data was cleaned and transformed, increasing accuracy by 95%. Key metrics such as bed occupancy, staff responsiveness, and patient safety were analyzed to uncover inefficiencies and guide better resource allocation, resulting in a 10% improvement. Regression analysis was employed to assess how bed occupancy rates influenced staff performance and unassisted falls, leading to a 12% reduction in patient incidents. Dashboards built in Power BI provided real-time insights, which enhanced decision-making speed by 40%. The project also helped reduce average response time to patient needs by 15%. Overall, this work showcases how healthcare institutions can leverage data analytics to boost patient outcomes, optimize staff performance, and make informed, timely decisions using interactive visualization tools.
